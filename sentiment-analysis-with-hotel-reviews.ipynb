This is usually used on social media posts and customer reviews in order to automatically understand if some users are positive or negative and why. The goal of this study is to show how sentiment analysis can be performed using python. Here are some of the main libraries we will use:\n\n- NLTK: the most famous python module for NLP techniques\n- Gensim: a topic-modelling and vector space modelling toolkit\n- Scikit-learn: the most used python machine learning library\n\nWe will use here some hotel reviews data. Each observation consists in one customer review for one hotel. Each customer review is composed of a textual feedback of the customer's experience at the hotel and an overall rating. The data can be found here:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe\n\nFor each textual review, we want to predict if it corresponds to a good review (the customer is happy) or to a bad one (the customer is not satisfied). The reviews overall ratings can range from 2.5/10 to 10/10. In order to simplify the problem we will split those into two categories:\n- bad reviews have overall ratings < 5\n- good reviews have overall ratings >= 5\n\nThe challenge here is to be able to predict this information using only the raw textual data from the review.\nLet's get it started!\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"9b15f7daa8f9c5cb04c1ff8974a9c0cefb672f6f"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Load data","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install azureml-core azureml-sdk --quiet","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-19T23:58:37.354165Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-19T23:58:37.354503Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-20T00:01:09.000150Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-19T23:58:37.354436Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-20T00:01:08.999408Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\u001b[33m  Retrying (Retry(total=4, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by 'NewConnectionError('<pip._vendor.urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x7a2214ccf828>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution',)': /simple/azureml-core/\u001b[0m\n\u001b[33m  Retrying (Retry(total=3, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by 'NewConnectionError('<pip._vendor.urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x7a2214ccf710>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution',)': /simple/azureml-core/\u001b[0m\n\u001b[33m  Retrying (Retry(total=2, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by 'NewConnectionError('<pip._vendor.urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x7a2214ccf630>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution',)': /simple/azureml-core/\u001b[0m\n\u001b[33m  Retrying (Retry(total=1, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by 'NewConnectionError('<pip._vendor.urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x7a2214ccf358>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution',)': /simple/azureml-core/\u001b[0m\n\u001b[33m  Retrying (Retry(total=0, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by 'NewConnectionError('<pip._vendor.urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x7a2214ccf438>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution',)': /simple/azureml-core/\u001b[0m\n\u001b[31m  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement azureml-core (from versions: )\u001b[0m\n\u001b[31mNo matching distribution found for azureml-core\u001b[0m\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"code","source":"try:\n    import azureml.core\n    import azureml\n    print(\"Azure ML packages are already installed.\")\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Azure ML packages are not installed.\")\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-19T23:58:14.980209Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-19T23:58:14.980525Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-19T23:58:14.986856Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-19T23:58:14.980469Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-19T23:58:14.985922Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Azure ML packages are not installed.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We first start by loading the raw data.

First let us remind the False Positive Rate formula, which corresponds to the x axis of the ROC curve: FPR (False Positive Rate) = # False Positives / # Negatives.\n\nHere the # Negatives corresponds to our number of good reviews which is very high because our dataset is imbalanced. This means that even with some False Positives, our FPR will tend to stay very low. Our model will be able to make a lot of false positives predictions and still have a low false positive rate, while increasing the true positive rate and therefore artificially increasing the AUC ROC metric.","metadata":{"_uuid":"65e4d155a09ff2750eed793b890bd99c35960da8"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# PR curve\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import average_precision_score, precision_recall_curve\nfrom sklearn.utils.fixes import signature\n\naverage_precision = average_precision_score(y_test, y_pred)\n\nprecision, recall, _ = precision_recall_curve(y_test, y_pred)\n\n# In matplotlib < 1.5, plt.fill_between does not have a 'step' argument\nstep_kwargs = ({'step': 'post'}\n               if 'step' in signature(plt.fill_between).parameters\n               else {})\n\nplt.figure(1, figsize = (15, 10))\nplt.step(recall, precision, color='b', alpha=0.2,\n         where='post')\nplt.fill_between(recall, precision, alpha=0.2, color='b', **step_kwargs)\n\nplt.xlabel('Recall')\nplt.ylabel('Precision')\nplt.ylim([0.0, 1.05])\nplt.xlim([0.0, 1.0])\nplt.title('2-class Precision-Recall curve: AP={0:0.2f}'.format(average_precision))","metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ce77133401f4c7862f7aa28c7f879217f382f93a"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A better metric in this imbalanced situation is the AUC PR (Area Under the Curve Precision Recall), or also called AP (Average Precision). \n\nWe can see that the precision decreases when we increase the recall. This shows us that we have to choose a prediction thresold adapted to our needs. If our goal is to have a high recall, we should set a low prediction thresold that will allow us to detect most of the observations of the positive class, but with a low precision. On the contrary, if we want to be really confident about our predictions but don't mind about not finding all the positive observations, we should set a high thresold that will get us a high precision and a low recall.\n\nIn order to know if our model performs better than another classifier, we can simply use the AP metric. To assess the quality of our model, we can compare it to a simple decision baseline. Let's take a random classifier as a baseline here that would predict half of the time 1 and half of the time 0 for the label.\n\nSuch a classifier would have a precision of 4.3%, which corresponds to the proportion of positive observations. For every recall value the precision would stay the same, and this would lead us to an AP of 0.043. The AP of our model is approximately 0.35, which is more than 8 times higher than the AP of the random method. This means that our model has a good predictive power.","metadata":{"_uuid":"a6a6977b4e48d28e637b85fed45064edf1725bfb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusion","metadata":{"_uuid":"1459faf9b176c226ce05ad23e4bee5832dfcba77"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It is completely possible to use only raw text as input for making predictions.
